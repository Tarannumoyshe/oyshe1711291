                <h2>The movie frozen about</h2>
                <p>When their kingdom becomes trapped in perpetual winter, fearless Anna (Kristen Bell) joins forces with mountaineer Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer sidekick to find Anna's sister, Snow Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), and break her icy spell. Although their epic journey leads them to encounters with mystical trolls, a comedic snowman (Josh Gad), harsh conditions, and magic at every turn, Anna and Kristoff bravely push onward in a race to save their kingdom from winter's cold grip.

                <h3>Olaf</h3>
                <p>Olaf represents the happiness Elsa and Anna shared as young children. His desire to experience summer is symbolic of how Elsa wants to return to the old days of her childhood with her sister as her best friend.</p>

                <h3>Kristoff</h3>
                <p>Kristoff was orphaned at a young age and placed in an orphanage thereafter. He was nevertheless too adventurous and free-spirited to be contained in such a facility; he spent a majority of his time sneaking out and exploring the surrounding wilderness.</p>

                <h3>Anna</h3>
                <p>Anna has nature powers and either unlocked them at the end of the movie as she lost her white hair streak, or could be given them back by the head troll if she asks.</p>
